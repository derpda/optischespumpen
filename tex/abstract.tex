\section{Abstract}
Optical pumping between Zeeman states of rubidium isotopes $^{87}$Rb and $^{85}$Rb that are split up by well controlled magnetic fields allows for the precise calculation of the earths magnetic field, hyperfine constants $A$ of the two isotopes as well as the relaxation time of the polarized states. The resulting hyperfine constants were calculated as
\begin{align}
	A_{^2S_{\nicefrac{1}{2}}}(^{87}Rb)&=\unit{(14.61\pm0.13)}{\micro\electronvolt}\\
	A_{^2S_{\nicefrac{1}{2}}}(^{85}Rb)&=\unit{(4.50\pm0.08)}{\micro\electronvolt}\\
	A_{^2P_{\nicefrac{1}{2}}}(^{87}Rb)&=\unit{(1.52\pm0.18)}{\micro\electronvolt}
\end{align}
The hyperfine constant $A_{^2P_{\nicefrac{1}{2}}}(^{85}Rb)$ could not be calculated since the relevant peaks could not be separated with the set-up.
The earths' magnetic field components were calculated to be
\begin{align}
	B_v&=\unit{(37.1\pm1.4)}{\micro T}\\
	B_h&=\unit{(2.36\pm 0.21)}{\micro T}
\end{align}
Of the two methods used to calculate the relaxation times, only the Dehmelt method produced a reasonable result for the relaxation time:
\begin{equation}
T_R=\unit{(4.8\pm1.5)}{ms}
\end{equation}
